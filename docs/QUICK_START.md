# ðŸš€ QuizLink - Quick Start Guide

## First Time Setup (Do this once)

1. **Install dependencies:**

   Open PowerShell in this folder and run:
   ```powershell
   # Install frontend dependencies
   npm install

   # Install backend dependencies
   cd server
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

## Running the Quiz

You need **TWO terminals** running at the same time:

### Option 1: Using Scripts (Windows)

1. Double-click `start-server.bat` (keep this window open)
2. Double-click `start-client.bat` (keep this window open)

### Option 2: Manual (Any OS)

**Terminal 1 - Start Backend Server:**
```bash
cd server
npm start
```
Keep this running! You should see: `Server running on port 3001`

**Terminal 2 - Start Frontend:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Keep this running! You should see the local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`)

## How to Use

1. **Admin (You):** 
   - Open `http://localhost:5173` on your computer
   - Click "Join as Admin"
   - Enter your name

2. **Players (Friends):**
   - Make sure they're on the same WiFi
   - Find your computer's IP address:

## Troubleshooting
