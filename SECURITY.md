## 🔐 Best Practices for Contributors

### When Writing Code

1. **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables
2. **Validate all inputs** - Don't trust user data
3. **Use parameterized queries** - Prevent SQL injection
4. **Sanitize outputs** - Prevent XSS
5. **Handle errors gracefully** - Don't expose internals

### When Handling User Data

1. **Minimize data collection** - Only what's needed
2. **Hash passwords** - Never store plain text
3. **Validate emails** - Prevent fake accounts
4. **Sanitize usernames** - No special characters
5. **Protect PII** - Don't expose emails publicly

### Security Checklist

Before submitting code:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Parameterized database queries
- [ ] Error messages don't expose internals
- [ ] User data properly sanitized
- [ ] CORS configured correctly
- [ ] Authentication required where needed

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Token Storage

**Current:** localStorage  
**Risk:** Accessible via JavaScript, vulnerable to XSS  
**Mitigation:**

- Sanitize all user inputs
- Content Security Policy (planned)
- Short token expiration (7-30 days)

### Password Hashing

**Current:** SHA-256  
**Future:** Upgrade to bcrypt/argon2 for better security

### Rate Limiting

**Current:** Cloudflare's built-in protection  
**Future:** Application-level rate limiting per user

---

## 📊 Security Roadmap

### Planned Improvements

- [ ] Implement bcrypt/argon2 for password hashing
- [ ] Add Content Security Policy
- [ ] Implement rate limiting per user
- [ ] Add 2FA (two-factor authentication)
- [ ] Email verification
- [ ] Account recovery flow
- [ ] Session management improvements
- [ ] Security headers audit
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] OWASP compliance review

## 🔄 Security Update Process

### When Security Issue is Reported

1. **Acknowledge** within 48 hours
2. **Investigate** and confirm
3. **Develop fix** in private
4. **Test thoroughly**
5. **Release patch** ASAP
6. **Notify users** if needed
7. **Credit reporter** (if desired)
8. **Publish advisory** post-fix

### Version Tagging

Security patches use **patch version**:

- Critical: `v1.0.1` → immediate
- Medium: `v1.0.2` → next release
- Low: Bundled with features
